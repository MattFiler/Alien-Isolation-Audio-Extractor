# Alien: Isolation Audio Extractor

A simple tool to export and name sound files within Alien: Isolation.

## How to use

1) [Click here](https://github.com/MattFiler/Alien-Isolation-Audio-Extractor/raw/master/Build/Audio%20Extractor.exe) to download the latest build. 
2) Once downloaded, copy the program into your Alien: Isolation game directory (where AI.exe is located).
3) Run the program and wait for it to finish.
4) Once finished, the tool will open the output folder for you (this can be manually found within Alien: Isolation's DATA folder).

## Notes

The final stage of conversion/renaming may take some time depending on the speed of your processor and disk due to the volume of files it has to process - please be patient!

## Final mentions

 * BNK extraction is made possible by a modified version of [rickvg's BNKExtract](https://github.com/rickvg/Wwise-BNKExtract).
 * WEM conversion is made possible by [hcs64's ww2ogg](https://github.com/hcs64/ww2ogg) and [Yirkha's REVORB](http://yirkha.fud.cz/progs/foobar2000/revorb.cpp).
